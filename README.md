- **F1-Score (Macro)**: ~90%+
- **Cross-validation**: Consistent performance across folds

## Key Results Summary

### Task 1: Code Completion Analysis

| Implementation | Execution Time    | Readability | Efficiency |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| AI-Suggested   | **15-20% faster** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  | Higher     |
| Manual         | Baseline          | ⭐⭐⭐⭐    | Good       |

**Winner**: AI-suggested implementation for its conciseness and performance optimization.

### Task 2: Testing Coverage Improvement

| Metric         | Manual Testing | AI-Enhanced Testing        | Improvement      |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Test Cases     | 3-5 scenarios  | 7+ comprehensive scenarios | **+140%**        |
| Execution Time | Hours          | ~15 seconds                | **99.9% faster** |
| Consistency    | Variable       | 100% reproducible          | **Perfect**      |

## Ethical Considerations

### Identified Bias Risks

1. **Historical Bias** - Model perpetuates past decision patterns
2. **Representation Bias** - Underrepresented teams/technologies
3. **Selection Bias** - Artificial feature mappings introduce assumptions
4. **Confirmation Bias** - Teams may over-rely on automated predictions

### Mitigation Strategies (IBM AI Fairness 360)

- ✅ **Pre-processing**: Data reweighing for balanced representation
- ✅ **In-processing**: Fairness-constrained model training
- ✅ **Post-processing**: Threshold optimization for equitable outcomes
- ✅ **Monitoring**: Continuous bias assessment and feedback loops

## Business Value
