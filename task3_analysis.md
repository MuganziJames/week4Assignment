# Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation - Analysis Summary

## Overview

This analysis implements a machine learning solution for predicting issue priority levels (high/medium/low) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from scikit-learn. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can help with resource allocation in healthcare settings.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (scikit-learn)
- **Size**: 569 samples, 30 features
- **Original Task**: Binary classification (malignant/benign)
- **Modified Task**: Multi-class priority prediction (high/medium/low)

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Feature Engineering**: Created priority levels based on tumor characteristics:

   - **High Priority**: Malignant tumors with large size or high texture values
   - **Medium Priority**: Smaller malignant tumors or large benign tumors requiring monitoring
   - **Low Priority**: Small benign tumors

2. **Data Cleaning**: No missing values found in the dataset
3. **Feature Scaling**: Applied StandardScaler to normalize all features
4. **Data Splitting**: 80% training, 20% testing with stratified sampling

## Model Implementation

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Parameters**:
  - n_estimators=100
  - max_depth=10
  - min_samples_split=5
  - min_samples_leaf=2

## Key Results

The model demonstrates strong performance across all evaluation metrics:

### Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy**: ~95%+ on test set
- **F1-Score (macro)**: ~95%+ for balanced performance across all classes
- **F1-Score (weighted)**: ~95%+ accounting for class imbalance
- **Cross-Validation**: Consistent performance across 5-fold CV

### Feature Importance

The most important features for priority prediction include:

1. Worst features (worst radius, worst texture, worst perimeter)
2. Mean features (mean radius, mean texture)
3. Size-related measurements (area, perimeter)

## Resource Allocation Insights

Based on the model's predictions:

1. **Priority Distribution**:

   - Expected case distribution varies based on the threshold settings
   - Model can adapt to different healthcare facility requirements

2. **Screening Recommendations**:

   - Primary screening should focus on size-related features (radius, area)
   - Texture analysis provides additional discriminative power
   - Worst-case measurements are particularly predictive

3. **Deployment Benefits**:
   - Automated triage system for incoming cases
   - Consistent priority assignment reducing human bias
   - Improved resource allocation efficiency

## Technical Implementation

- **Deliverable**: Jupyter Notebook (`task3_predictive_analytics.ipynb`)
- **Model Persistence**: Saved model and scaler for deployment
- **Reproducibility**: All code includes random seeds and version controls

## Future Enhancements

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search optimization included in notebook
2. **Additional Models**: Could compare with SVM, XGBoost, or Neural Networks
3. **Real-world Integration**: API development for hospital information systems
4. **Continuous Learning**: Model updating mechanism with new data
